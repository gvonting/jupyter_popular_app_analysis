# jupyter_popular_game_analysis

This jupyter notebook was created from a project from Dataquest where I was tasked with finding the most profitable app profiles in the Apple iOS Store and the Google Play Store to then make a suggestion to a company that was interested in where they should focus their development efforts for a new app.

The data sets are thousands of lines long and they were downloaded from kaggle.com. There was multiple rounds of data cleaning to end up with a dataset that was able to be analyzed. Then I was able to create lists of the different app genres that were available on the app stores to see which type of apps had the most popularity and provide this data to the software development company to lead them in the right direction for a new app idea.
