    "In this table, there is a large number of users who have downloaded apps that are mostly practical apps. Looking at the game genre, there are a large amount of user that have downloaded game related apps. Considering the family genre is also mainly consisting of games that are family appropriate, there is a large userbase for games on the Google Play store.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "In both the Google Play Store and the Apple iOS store, there is evidence to show that a large amount of users are interested in game type apps. With the nature of games, a simple game that does not rely on a large playerbase can gain attraction quickly. If there is marketing behind a game, a multiplayer game has the potential to attract a userbase that will promote the game themsleves, leading to the game to grow more over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, we should put development effort towards the game genre. This has the greatest potential to create returns on investment compared to the effort that would be needed to create a larger user base for something such as a social media platform. If the game app is profitable on the Google Play store, we will carry it over to the Apple iOS store."
